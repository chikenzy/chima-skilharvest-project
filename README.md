Analytical performance of Chikenzie Business Enterprise

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of Chikenzie Business Enterprise, a Nigerian-based venture with a market presence across the five geographical regions of the country. The enterprise operates multiple stores, offering a variety of business lines and product models. The analysis covers the fiscal period from 2001 to 2016, examining different trade dates and day categories to understand units sold and total revenue generated. By evaluating these parameters, the project aims to provide valuable insights into sales trends and performance, enabling informed decision-making and compelling storytelling.

## 	Data source
The primary source of data is MS Excel, and this is open-source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as;

  - Kaggle
  -  FRED
  -   repository site
  -    google 

## 	Data cleaning and preparation
Processes involved pivoting, different Excel functions
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, the following action is performed;
1.	Data loading and inspection
2.	Handling missing variables
3.	Data cleaning and formatting

4.	## 	Data tools used
5.	MS Excel [download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  - Microsoft Power Bi
  - Google sheet
  -Google software

These are the major tools used for the analyses, Helps to pivot and analyse data

## Exploratory Data analysis(EDA)
 This involves Exploring data to answer some questions about the data such as,
Market
-	the highest market by revenue and units sold 
-	the lowest market by units sold 
### Religion
-	the highest region by revenue
-	 the lowest region by revenue 
-	The  lowest region by unit sold-
### Store
-	store with the highest revenue and list units sold
Trade date
-	trade date with the highest revenue as well as the highest unit sold
### Model
-	the model with the least units sold, compared with that of the highest unit sold
-	model with the highest revenue Line of business 
### Line of Business
-	what line of business generated the highest revenue
-	line of business with the list unit
   
###  Day Category
-	 highest day category by revenue and units sold 
-	Lowest day category by unit sold 

The above questions will be answered using the pivot analysis, and the process involves;
  I.	Access the data
  II.	Have a critical study of the data
  III.	With the use of the ‘IF’ function, access the category of the units sold to have a holistic view of their performance rate in terms of sales
#### Pivot Table field
To access the pivot data table field;

-	Go to insert
#### Pivot table
-	Select a table or range on the field 
-	Select a new worksheet
-	Select OK
-	You will be brought to a new worksheet with a PIVOT TABLE FIELD
#### The Pivot Field
The essence of the pivot field is for ease of summarization of data based on the data you are working with.

It has 4 major components;
-	Row: data to appear horizontally
-	Column: data to appear in the column field

-	Click bottom or top( as the case may be)
-	OK
#### sort for the highest or lowest
-	Right click
-	Click sort
-	Sort smallest to largest or vice versa
-	OK
#### visualize
-	Click fn+alt+f1 function
-	Copy and paste it on your new worksheet

## Report/Visualization
Summarization from the pivot table field will give us a good graphic /pictorial /chart of the analysis for ease of understanding and comprehension.
Visualization is done in Excel from the pivot table field thus;
